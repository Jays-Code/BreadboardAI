    "critique": "The submitted frames reveal a critical failure in the video generation process, as all visual content intended for the 'Generated Image' sections is entirely missing, replaced by static placeholders. Consequently, it's impossible to assess narrative coherence, visual complexity, or how well the visuals follow the intended narrative arc (Hook, Journey, Climax, Outro) because there are no actual visuals to evaluate. While the placeholder text and captions are legible against the plain background, the video utterly fails to deliver any visual storytelling or compelling imagery necessary for a dynamic narrative about 'The Ancient Journey of Spinach'.",

      "Develop a clear visual strategy for each segment of the narrative arc (Hook, Journey, Climax, Outro) with specific imagery representing historical periods, geographical locations, and the cultural or agricultural evolution of spinach.",
      "Introduce visual dynamism and scene complexity; move beyond static images to show transitions, events, or processes relevant to spinach's journey through time.",
      "Integrate captions more creatively with the visuals, using lower thirds, animated text, or contextual overlays that enhance, rather than just state, the narrative, ensuring strong contrast for readability against diverse backgrounds."
