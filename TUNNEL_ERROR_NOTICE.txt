CRITICAL DISCOVERY:
The screenshot you provided specifically shows this error:
`Unable to forward localhost:5173. spawn ... code-tunnel.exe ENOENT`

This means your VS Code installation is missing the tunnel component required to forward ports from Colab to your local machine. **This is why localhost isn't loading.**

I have fixed the `debug_network.py` script so you can verify the servers are running remotely. Please run the cell again.

However, to access the app, we need to bypass the broken VS Code tunnel. I will update the notebook to provide you with the **Direct Colab Proxy URL** instead of relying on localhost.
