Ralph: Dual-Port Operational Guidelines

Execution: Always use npm run start:all to trigger both the Vite frontend (5173) and the Node backend (3000).

Tunneling: If the user cannot see the UI, verify that both output.serve_kernel_port_as_window(5173) and (3000) have been executed in the active notebook.

Hardware Care: Do not run heavy build processes locally. Always offload npm install and server execution to the Colab Remote terminal to protect the ThinkPad's dual-core CPU.

Ralph: Stack Verification Protocol

Routine: After executing the Master Startup Cell, Ralph MUST run the check_stack_health() cell.

Troubleshooting: If Port 5173 is down, Ralph should check package.json for the --host flag. If Port 3000 is down, Ralph should inspect the server.js logs for database connection errors.

ThinkPad P40 Safety: If the health check fails three times, Ralph must stop all background tasks to prevent the local CPU from "spinning" on broken processes.
