          "new_narrator_script": "In 1987, facing a deadline disaster, Matt Groening hastily sketched a new family to avoid losing his life's work. The Simpsons were born! Groening's underground comic 'Life in Hell' satirized institutions and showed his subversive wit. This raw talent soon grabbed the attention of a Hollywood legend. James L. Brooks, creator of iconic sitcoms like Taxi, was already a TV titan. He needed edgy shorts for 'The Tracey Ullman Show' and found Groening's unique vision. But the animators made a 'mistake' – coloring the family yellow! The unique look stuck, and voice actors Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner breathed life into Homer and Marge. Then came Sam Simon, the unsung hero, who ensured the writing staff maintained creative freedom. His '13 and out' motto pushed them to create the best episodes, fearing cancellation. This era became known as the 'Golden Age,' delivering classic episodes like 'Marge vs. the Monorail,' penned by a young Conan O'Brien, that redefined animated comedy. The Simpsons not only became a cultural phenomenon but also subtly ingrained its subversive view of institutions into younger generations, forever changing television and shaping a cynical yet heartfelt world view.",
