          "new_narrator_script": "In 1987, Matt Groening faced a crisis. Asked to create shorts for Fox, he learned anything he created would be owned by the network. Desperate, in the lobby, he hastily sketched new characters named after his family – the Simpsons! A bold, yellow family that would change everything. Their crude designs and unexpected yellow skin, a colorist's choice to make them pop, became their signature. With iconic voices like Julie Kavner for Marge and Nancy Cartwright for Bart, these shorts captivated audiences, leading to a groundbreaking TV series. Producer James L. Brooks famously shielded the show from network interference, while Sam Simon championed a writer-driven, no-limits approach, believing '13 and out' was their creative license. This fearlessness led to a ‘Golden Age’ of groundbreaking comedy, tackling complex themes with both cynicism and heartwarming depth. The Simpsons premiered to 26.7 million viewers, shaping minds and TV forever, proving that sometimes, the best ideas are born under pressure.",
