          "new_narrator_script": "In 1989, Matt Groening was at Fox, about to sign a deal. He learned anything he created would be owned by the network. So, right there in the lobby, he hastily sketched a new family, naming them after his own: The Simpsons. Groening's subversive comic 'Life in Hell' caught the eye of legendary producer James L. Brooks, who hired him for animated shorts on 'The Tracey Ullman Show.' In a last-minute scramble, Groening quickly drew the family. By chance, animators at Klasky Csupo colored their skin yellow and Marge's hair blue – a bold, unique look that stood out. Voice talents like Julie Kavner as Marge and Nancy Cartwright as Bart brought them to life. The shorts were an instant hit, with audiences laughing significantly more than at the main show. Brooks saw the potential and pitched a full series to Fox. With Sam Simon as showrunner, an ethos of '13 and out' encouraged fearless, uncensored storytelling. This creative freedom, amplified by brilliant writers like Conan O'Brien, led to the show's 'Golden Age.' Episodes like 'Marge vs. the Monorail' redefined animated comedy. The Simpsons premiered to 26.7 million viewers, becoming a cultural touchstone. Its cynical yet heartfelt humor normalized subversive ideas, forever changing television and shaping a generation. From a lobby sketch to a global phenomenon, The Simpsons proved that even the most chaotic families can capture the world's heart. Thank you, Sam Simon, for your vision.",
