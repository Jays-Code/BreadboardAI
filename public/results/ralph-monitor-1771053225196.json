          "new_narrator_script": "In 1987, under pressure to create new characters for Fox or lose his comic rights, Matt Groening had minutes to invent a family. He rapidly sketched Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, and Bart, naming them after his own family. These initial designs were intentionally crude, but animator Györgyi Peluce made a groundbreaking decision: yellow skin for the characters! Voice actors Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner were quickly hired. Kavner improvised Marge’s distinct tired voice, while Nancy Cartwright, originally auditioning for Lisa, famously became Bart. Legendary producer James L. Brooks, impressed by Groening’s 'Life in Hell' comics, commissioned these shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show. With Sam Simon joining the team, ensuring creative freedom and quality, The Simpsons defied all expectations. Despite early network skepticism, it premiered to record numbers in 1987, becoming an instant cultural phenomenon and forever reshaping American comedy.",
