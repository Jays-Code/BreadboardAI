Asked to create animated shorts for Fox, he realized anything from his existing comic, 'Life in Hell,' would be owned by the network. So, right there in the lobby, he hastily sketched a new, yellow family.\n\nThis hurried creation, along with legendary producers James L. Brooks and Sam Simon, set the stage for something extraordinary. Their initial designs were crude, the animation budget tight, and crucially, the characters were given an unusual yellow skin tone.\n\nThis quirky look, combined with a subversive, often cynical humor, made them instantly stand out. Network executives, initially dismissive, famously predicted it would be '13 and out.' But they underestimated the power of this rebellious family.\n\nThe Simpsons premiered to a staggering 26.7 million viewers, becoming an overnight cultural phenomenon. They blended heartfelt moments with sharp satire, pioneering a new era of animation that challenged norms and mirrored society.\n\nFor over three decades, The Simpsons hasn't just entertained; it’s subtly shaped our worldview, ingrained distrust of institutions, and inspired countless creators. It’s a testament to how bold, unconventional vision can truly change the world.",
