He had no idea he was giving birth to 'The Simpsons'. Tasked with animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, he teamed with the legendary James L. Brooks, a TV titan, and Sam Simon, a sharp writer. It was a risky venture, especially when an animation colorist accidentally painted the characters yellow, creating their iconic look. The shorts exploded in popularity. Sam Simon's mantra was '13 and out' – encouraging wild creativity since cancellation seemed inevitable. This rebellious spirit defined the show. Conan O'Brien's 'Marge vs. the Monorail' episode exemplified this new era of outrageous yet heartfelt storytelling. Despite behind-the-scenes conflicts and an accidental yellow skin tone, The Simpsons premiered to record numbers, becoming a global phenomenon that reshaped comedy and culture, delivering poignant messages with subversive humor, proving even a hurried drawing can change the world.",
