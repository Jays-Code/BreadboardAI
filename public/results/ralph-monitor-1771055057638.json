In a desperate lobby dash, he quickly sketched a new, unconventional family, naming them after his own: Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie... and Bart. Fox liked his rebellious characters for animated shorts, but the animation team made a surprising choice that defined their look forever. Voice actors Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner delivered Homer and Marge's unique voices. Nancy Cartwright, initially auditioning for Lisa, became Bart, cementing their iconic personalities. These shorts, part of The Tracey Ullman Show, were an instant hit, garnering more laughs than the main acts and signaling a coming revolution. Producer James L. Brooks saw the potential for a full prime-time series. With fellow writer Sam Simon, they built Springfield and its unforgettable residents. Despite internal clashes and early doubts, The Simpsons debuted to an unprecedented 26.7 million viewers, becoming a cultural phenomenon that changed TV forever.",
