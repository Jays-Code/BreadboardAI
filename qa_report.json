    "critique": "These frames are critically underdeveloped and fail on nearly all criteria. They display only white text on a plain black background, completely missing the 'Vast starfield with nebulae, slowly zooming out to reveal more galaxies' described for Scene 1. This results in a complete lack of alignment with the 'Dynamic' tone, zero narrative accuracy for the intended scene, and minimal kinetic engagement as the background is entirely static. There is no composition depth beyond two basic layers (text over black). While the text fidelity itself is acceptable, the absence of core visual assets makes a true fidelity assessment impossible.",
    "improvement_suggestions": [
      "Immediately implement the 'Vast starfield with nebulae, slowly zooming out' as the primary visual background for Scene 1. This is crucial for both narrative accuracy and achieving a 'Dynamic' tone.",
      "Ensure the text appears with a visible and energetic 'snap_zoom' effect. The current frames only show words appearing, not the specified animation.",
      "Adhere to the '3-Second Hook' guideline: the video must start with high-energy movement or a striking image, not a blank screen. The starfield should be present from frame one.",
      "Introduce multi-layer compositions by ensuring the starfield and nebulae provide clear depth, with elements potentially moving at different rates.",
      "Review typography to align with 'Neo-Grotesque' or 'Impact' styles, with high contrast (e.g., White text, Black stroke, colorful neo-shadows) and 'word_pop' animation for maximum engagement."
