    "critique": "The provided frames are almost entirely black, severely failing to meet the visual objectives and tone. None of the described visual concepts like 'vast starfield with nebulae,' 'historical space images,' or 'stylized animation of Earth' are present. The frames show static text on a black background, which completely undermines the 'Dynamic' tone and 'Kinetic Engagement' requirements. Composition depth is non-existent beyond the text layer. While the text itself is clear, the complete absence of intended visual assets and background content indicates a critical fidelity issue. The video starts effectively from a black screen, which violates the 'no fade-ins from black' rule for a high-energy hook.",
    "improvement_suggestions": [
      "Immediately implement the 'vast starfield with nebulae' in Scene 1 as the background to establish context and dynamism.",
      "Ensure the 'montage grid' in Scene 2 actually displays the specified 'historical space images' rather than being empty placeholders.",
      "Apply the specified camera motions ('slowly zooming out,' 'smooth camera pan_left') and text effects ('snap_zoom,' 'box_highlight') to ensure constant motion and visual engagement.",
      "Introduce clear multi-layer compositions for scenes involving starfields and planet animations to create visual depth.",
      "Utilize high-quality, vibrant imagery for all described assets to meet fidelity requirements and enhance the 'cinematic' feel.",
      "Address the '3-Second Hook' by ensuring the video does not start from black; instead, begin immediately with high-energy movement or a striking visual."
